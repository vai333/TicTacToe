# TicTacToe
A TIC TAC TOE game has been made using HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT with attractive user interface along with sound which is added on the event listener "onclick".

--> you just have to extract the zip file and then go into the Tictactoe folder and click on the tictactoemain.html and it will open in your default browser.

--> internal scripting has been used rather than an external .js file for the DOM manipulation.
